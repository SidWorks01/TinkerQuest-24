## üíª About DocAI

### Features
DocAI streamlines the report-making process by automating key tasks while ensuring the authenticity of medical information. Here's how our application addresses these challenges:

1. **Automated Report Generation**: DocAI leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automate report creation. Doctors can focus on patient care while our system generates accurate and concise reports.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Our intuitive web interface, built using Django and Ajax, provides a seamless experience for both doctors and patients. Users can easily input data, view reports, and access relevant information.

3. **Enhanced Readability**: We use Plotly and Plotly Express to create interactive visualizations within reports. Graphs, charts, and diagrams help convey complex medical data in a clear and digestible format.

4. **Secure Authentication**: Google OAuth3 integration ensures secure access for authorized users. Doctors can log in securely and manage patient data.

5. **Virtual Assistant Bot**: DocAI introduces an NLP-powered chatbot that educates users about minor symptoms, preventive measures, and general health awareness. This innovative feature enhances patient engagement and promotes well-being.
